Good day gentlemen and ladies,

I myself is known as Tharun prabu. I'm a fine guy with quick learning capabilities. 
You can find me doing Video editing, Content writing, Analysing data and coming up with market strategies, except the electrical stuffs I've been studying for my bachelor's degree.
Pardon, that was a joke. I do know basics stuffs about electricals and I've worked as a solar designer for 10 months. You can say that I know my way in a lot of things.
